# Simpson  
This code takes a given set of data and computes an approximation of the integral using simpsons 1/3 rule. If the data has an odd number of intervals the user will be warned that a trapezoidal rule will be used for the last interval. The intervals will need to be equally spaced, if not the user will be given an error.  
## Inputs  
**x** vector containing the x values of the data  
**y** vector containing the y values of the data  
## Outputs  
**I** approximate integral of the data
