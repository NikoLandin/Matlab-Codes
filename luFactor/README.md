# luFactor  
This code takes a 3 by 3 matrix a and factors it into a  
1. Lower matrix  
2. Upper matrix  
3. Pivot matrix  
This code is limited to a 3 by 3 matrix. This code will also perform pivoting.  
## Inputs  
**A** coefficient matrix  
## Outputs  
**L** lower triangular matrix  
**U** upper triangular matrix  
**P** the pivot matrix
